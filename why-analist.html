    <div class="quote">“Now I think it’s one of the most useless questions an
      adult can ask a child—What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing
      up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.”

      <div class="subpage2-content">Until a year and a half ago, I never considered
        working in IT. My only experience with programming was in an IT class in
        high school, when I had to program a 'car' - which was nothing more than
        a triangle - to travel a particular route. I liked the reasoning behind it
        but I thought of it as a game with a very old-fashioned interface and I
        didn’t see the link with programming in real life.
        So that was it for then.</br></br>

        In the summer of 2019 I went for a drink with an ex-colleague, we had both
        been working as a work simplifier at Colruyt. After I left the company
        she changed roles and now worked as a business architect. I was triggered
        by her job description and I started searching for information about
        the different roles that exist in IT.</br></br>

        The role of functional analist immediately appealed to me. I like the
        combination of analysis and communication, building a bridge between the
        business and the software team, working together towards a common goal.
        I like things to move forward so I really look forward to working in a
        fast evolving industry.</br></br>

        I’m very happy that I’m given the opportunity to work as a functional
        analist for FPS Finance. I'm excited to contribute to projects with added
        social value and to be part of a very diverse team.
